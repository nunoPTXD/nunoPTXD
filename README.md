## Hey there! ![Hey](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d798692-96c2-4517-a71b-7d93f4000c63)


I’m Nuno, a student currently learning programming.

I’m still early in my coding journey, but I love building things whenever I get the chance.

Right now I’m mainly focused on Flutter, since it’s part of my school project. I’m also taking a coding course, and when I’m not working on school stuff, I like coding small learning projects just for fun.

I may not be super active yet while I’m still learning, but as I improve, I’ll definitely become more active and start pushing more fun ideas and projects here.

I’m currently working on:
A Flutter app for my school project (PAP)
Small learning projects to improve my fundamentals

I’m currently learning:
- Flutter & Dart
- Firebase
- General software development through my school course

Fun facts
- I do powerscaling for fun
- My main favorite anime is Solo Leveling
- I’m either of super lazy and super hard-working
- I’m a pretty cool guy once you get to know me
- **Hobbies:** Gaming, School, Gym/sports, Anime
